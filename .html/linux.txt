conda activate zvika_env


Normal Package Manager - brew
=============================
conda install -c anaconda git curl
# now we can follow https://joseph-long.com/writing/linuxbrew-with-ancient-git/
brew install curl
brew update

GVIM compilation
================
brew install gtk+
# note - I first tried gtk+3 - it installs, but vim configure doesn't find it
./configure --prefix=/home/cluster/users/zvikah/local | tee configure.log
# later, I managed to run with gtk+3 ; it looks nicer :-)
# need to write explicitly in gui options (or however it was called)
# read the log, make sure it found gtk
make
make install

Beyond Compare
==============
download tar.gz
complains about missing bz2 library
but 'locate' finds it!
simple soft link to bc/lib64/beyondcompare/ solves it

VNC-Server
==========

tl;dr:
just download 
https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.10.1
and run from there.
(note - later version - 1.11.0 - seems to require root permission)

long story:
brew install tiger-vnc
failed with 'attr'
then run
brew install -v attr
log path is printed
brew edit attr
# get rid of 'lint' flag, and other strange flags
until brew install attr is working

then failed on 'brew install libprelude'
'brew edit libprelude', following https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/pull/21756/files

It's installed!
Now I can run:
x0vncserver
but it's not good enough - it's not virtualized desktop, and seems to ignore ~/.vnc/xstartup
there is's a 
vncserver, not in $PATH - but it fails because of missing Xvnc

therefore:
brew install x11vnc
it doesn't have Xvnc

But I found it by just downloading
https://bintray.com/tigervnc/stable/tigervnc/1.11.0

I've soft linked its X11 to Brew's one - it continued a little, but then failed

Tried running only downloaded, without using Brew - but it failed, with hard wired global paths


The VNC is Empty
================
So, we need some sort of a Desktop, or just Windows Manager
 vi ~/.vnc/xstartup

# my attempts...  
# metacity &   # default working, but almost useless
# the next two are too spartan
# /home/cluster/users/zvikah/temp/dwm-6.2/dwm &
# /home/cluster/users/zvikah/tools/spectrwm/bin/spectrwm &

#that's one is decent!
# but tooks long time to gather all dependencies to build
/home/cluster/users/zvikah/tools/icewm-2.0.0/bin/icewm-session
xterm &   # or better terminal


We need a good terminal
=======================
Most of them need vte, which is quite a headache to install
however, `alacritty` is easier to install
but it's not good enough for me...
so, let's `brew install vte3` (the 3 is for GTK3)
currently, I succeeded by going back to version

but recent versions depends on some strange define that exists only in newer Linux kernel
going back in local brew git to `vte3.whatever` that supplied 0.56.2 worked for me. Yeah!

xfce-terminal
=============
I've chosen to try compile it.
Initially, I tried to choose slightly olderv versions. But it was a waste of time.
It worked with the greatest and latest :-)

versions:
xfce4-terminal-0.8.9.2/
libxfce4ui-4.15.8/
libxfce4util-4.15.6/
xfconf-4.15.1/

hacks:
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/cluster/users/zvikah/tools/xfce/lib/pkgconfig/
    ./configure --prefix=/home/cluster/users/zvikah/tools/xfce

    # to fix some vapi/gir error:
    cd /home/cluster/users/zvikah/.linuxbrew/Homebrew/share/vala/vapi
    ln -s /home/cluster/users/zvikah/tools/xfce/share/vala/vapi/libxfce4util-1.0.vapi
