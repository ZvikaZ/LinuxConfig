- autocomplete
- beautify git (colors, aliases, diff)
- icewm:
    learn shortcuts
    improve monitors at toolbar
- make 'md' function
- tkdiff: why is it ugly? maybe I'm missing something?
- fonts: is it possible to install ttf-mscorefonts-installer ?
    I've tried some combination of:
    https://gist.github.com/lightonphiri/5811226a1fba0b3df3be73ff2d5b351c
    actually, mainly this (the second part!):
    http://tsengf.blogspot.com/2012/03/install-new-fonts-in-linux-without-root.html
    didn't work with https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono
    but maybe will work with other fonts?
    should try mscorefonts, maybe it'd be better
    it appears that we *have* ttmkfdir
- mail? sending? the envelope in the corner?
